# 🚀 node-express-profile-app

A mini full-stack web application that renders an Instagram-style profile page using **Node.js, Express, and EJS**.

This project demonstrates how backend data can be dynamically passed to the frontend using **server-side rendering**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This app simulates a social media profile page where:

- User details are rendered dynamically
- Posts are generated from backend data
- Followers & following counts update from server
- Content is displayed using EJS templating

It helped me understand how real-world web apps connect frontend with backend logic.
